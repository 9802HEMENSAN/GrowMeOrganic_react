## Objective

The primary goal of this assignment is to create a React application that demonstrates your proficiency in working with React, Vite, MUI components, data handling, and creating complex UI components.

## Getting Started

To start working on this assignment, follow the steps outlined in each task.

### Task 1: Application Configuration

1. Create a new React application using Typescript and Vite.
2. Familiarize yourself with [Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).
3. Configure the application with MUI by referring to the [MUI getting started guide](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/).

2. Convert the JSON data into TypeScript models/interfaces.
3. Display the data in a table using the [MUI Data Grid](https://mui.com/x/react-data-grid/).

### Task 4: Second Page of the Application (Component 2)

1. Create a new component to display department and sub-department information.
2. Use the provided JSON data (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uQCFny5aXfMD9v2TPy3rbE8EHw-xZVdZfj4g-2Yv6IU/edit?usp=sharing).
